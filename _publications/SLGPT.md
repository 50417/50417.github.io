## Abstract
Simulink model files are normally generated by the Simulink toolchain. SLGPT gathers Simulink model files from open-source repositories and a random model generator. SLGPT then uses these Simulink model files to adapt OpenAI's widely used GPT-2 language model to learn the structure of these Simulink model files.
