## Abstract
Having readily available corpora is crucial for performing replication, reproduction, extension, and verification studies of existing research tools and techniques. MATLAB/Simulink is a de-facto standard tool in several safety-critical industries for system modeling and analysis, compiling models to code, and deploying code to embedded hardware. There is no commonly used corpus for large-scale model change studies because there is no readily available corpus. EvoSL is the first large corpus of Simulink projects that includes model and project changes and allows redistribution. EvoSL is available under a permissive open-source license and contains its collection and analysis tools. Using a subset of EvoSL, we replicated a case study of model changes on a single closed-source industrial project.
