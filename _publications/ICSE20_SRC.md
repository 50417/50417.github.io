## Abstract
Testing cyber-physical system (CPS) development tools such as MathWorksâ€™ Simulink is very important as they are widely used in design, simulation, and verification of CPS data-flow models. Ex- isting randomized differential testing frameworks such as SLforge leverages semi-formal Simulink specifications to guide random model generation which requires significant research and engineer- ing investment along with the need to manually update the tool, whenever MathWorks updates model validity rules. To address the limitations, we propose to learn validity rules automatically by learning a language model using our framework DeepFuzzSL from existing corpus of Simulink models. In our experiments, DeepFuz- zSL consistently generate over 90% valid Simulink models and also found 2 confirmed bugs by MathWorks Support.
